# Deep Learning Labs - TDDE70

A Lab series that explore deep neural networks using pytorch. Completed during spring 2024

## Lab 0

Introduction to experiments and training neural networks with PyTorch.

## Lab 1

this lab explores autoencoders and UNet models and use them to perform two image-to-image tasks:

1. Denoising:
2. Semantic Segmentation:

GTA image dataset is to large to upload to git. 

## Lab 2

Introduces Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and use it to generate images of numbers from the mnist dataset.

## Lab 3

Explores graph neural networks with PyG and use it to predict energy of molecules.
